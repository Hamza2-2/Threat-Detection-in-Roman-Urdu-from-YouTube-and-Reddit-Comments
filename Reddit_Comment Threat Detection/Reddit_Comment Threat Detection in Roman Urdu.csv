whether you like it or not it is an absolute fact that we live in the most peaceful time in human history and it would be remiss if we didnt recognize the uss efforts in getting it to that point and if were looking at world war  as a divergent point for what the world is going to look like then the only option from what im getting from yall is for the us to take a complete step back and not police the world right

only they literally tried a decade or two earlier and it didnt work out russia wouldve ran rampant because theyre definitely not going to take a step back and britain likely wouldnt have gave up its massive colonial empire so quickly

and if the us didnt develop nukes first and show the world just how devastating they are we wouldnt be living in a mad world where large scale wars between nuclear countries are generally seen an absolute last option

like yall are right i for sure dont get to choose and the us has done insanely fucked up shit since world war  and even still to a degree what im trying to say that even if they didnt do any of that stuff things would overall be worse thats a tough pill to swallow i know 

but if you can explain to me why we are living in a state of unparalleled peace compared to the rest of human history without citing the uss massive influence hey im all ears",threat

while the shooter was distracted trying to kill everyone playing dead in a corner he charges at the shooter from behind who then spun around to get  shots off at the victim during the tackle the heroic assault forced the shooter to stumble to the ground but after that naeem rashid was down for good laying there helpless while the shooter gets back up and walks backwards firing off  more shots from a close distance to finish him off

after that maybe the shooter just assumed he was dead the initial shots during the tackle hit around his left shoulder or arm maybe most of them even hopefully missed but the final  or  while he was laying on the ground  hit him i really do hope he survives because thats a lot of punishment to take up close like that it explains why after all those times walking over him he never fired again at least",threat
Reddit,1enfbay,"indian here  congrats it was so good to see  from the subcontinent on the podium

but i have a question  what happened to pakistan sports

after the first  postcolonial olympics  india and pakistan had similar performances

 india  gold  silver  bronze   fieldhockey  wrestling
 pakistan   gold  silver  bronze   fieldhockey  wrestling  boxing

this is impressive given pakistans fewer population and they played in  less olympic than india due to the  moscow olympic boycott but then something happened after  

over the next  olympics  paris as of aug their performances diverged

 india  gold  silver  bronze  fieldhockey  wrestling  boxing  shooting  badminton  weightlifting  athletics  tennis
 pakistan  gold todays medal

in india pakistanis are seen as more athletic but what happened since  i mean indias record is also terrible given the population 

india on the other hand has a hard time converting to gold or silver  bronzes vs  golds and even in this olympics there has been six th place finishes so farhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiindiaatthesummerolympics

Reddit,rnq59x,true and i think im wrong for bringing in race to begin with the reason i did is because in the us where i am mostly black and muslim and minorities in general are stereotyped and seen as the most dangerous and threatening people but white people are doing the most random killings here so it seems theres a willful and brainwashed blind spot for a lot of people here its also interesting to think about the motivation for people doing mass shootings muslims i think are typically religiously motivated for killings americans white or black seem to be motivated from mental illness or societal resentment you could argue religious fanaticism is a symptom of some mental illness as well and also a different type of societal resentment but it comes from a place of martyrdom rather nihilistic rage,threat

Reddit,1enfbay,"especially for indians  

in my opinion throwing javelin  twice in the olympic final is really commendable and huge kudos to arshad even though both the mothers were super happy about them and everyone needs to acknowledge the hardwork and dedication of him towards the sport he has gotten all the respect and acknowledge he needs to have around the globe especially from indians

ill still rate neeraj performance top notch he has consistently performed well in all past events and never lost to arshad it was pretty obvious later on in the game he came into pressure of defending gold medal but securing podium finish in consecutive olympics is not everyones cup of tea
apart from cricket it was one of those times when indians were going crazy during midnight for any other sport and this has to be a greatest achievement of indian athlete

apart from this on a serious note praising anyone who has done something exceptional is always a sign of healthy camaraderie among nations but when it comes to pakistan as an indian i have huge respect to an athlete but ill still prefer in maintaining a safe distance from over praising a athelete from an enemy nation we should not forget that pakistan is the major source of terrorism in india we have lost many soldiers fighting against pakistan i dont even remember pakistani people praising neeraj over his olympic gold medal in tokyo its always indians who tend to forget the scar and always one side love towards enemy nation until they give us another setback through their terrorist mindset and remember rage is not against an athlete but his country where sadly people are not praising neeraj for his silver but tagging our boy as looser because they have gold medal and also the only medal so praise but dont bootlick over someone who dont understand your emotions and never think anything great about your countries achievements

they never celebrated our worldcup victory they are not creating reels over our hockey bronze even they had good hockey team back then never celebrated chandrayan  never acknowledged our success in all the fields like manufacturing finance developmentetc rather they feed in the minds of children that india oppresses muslims and their rights they wrongly claim kashmir which his illegal occupied for past  years if india was so intolerant towards muslims we would have never liberated bangladesh and former head of bangladesh wouldnt have choose  hindu majority  secular  country after escaping from her country
its sadly only us indians who always forget what pakistan did to us in the past and celebrate their success
